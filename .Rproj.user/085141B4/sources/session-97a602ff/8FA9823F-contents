Description: The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies has
    enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of gene expression in tissue sections. 
    Despite the emergence of single-cell resolution platforms, most ST 
    sequencing studies still operate at the multi-cell resolution. Consequently,
    deconvolution of cell identities within the spatial spots has become 
    imperative for characterizing cell type-specific spatial organization.  
    To this end, we introduce SpatialDeX, a regression model-based method for
    estimating cell type proportions in tumor ST spots.  SpatialDeX exhibited
    comparable performance to reference-based methods and outperformed other
    reference-free methods with simulated ST data. Using experimental ST data,
    SpatialDeX demonstrated superior performance compared with both 
    reference-based and reference-free approaches.
